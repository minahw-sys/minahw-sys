### About Me

Financial analyst with experience in FP&A, operational finance, and financial reporting.

My work has focused on budgeting support, variance analysis, accrual forecasting, and recurring performance reporting across functions including Marketing and R&D. I have worked extensively with financial datasets within ERP and Excel environments to support planning and reporting processes.

With a master’s degree in Analytics, I continue to strengthen technical capabilities in SQL and business intelligence tools while applying them within financial reporting and performance analysis contexts.
